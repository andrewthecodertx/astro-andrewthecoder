## Yearning for Life

In shadows cast, where whispers dwell,  
A yearning heart's forbidden spell,  
Desire cloaked in somber guise,  
A soul seeks solace, longing to die  

With rhythmic beats, a mournful sound,  
With echoes deep, despair unbound,  
Yet midst the darkness, hope takes flight,  
A glimmer strong, a guiding light.  

For life, though wearied, holds its sway,  
In moments bright, where colors play,  
A tapestry of joy, so rare,  
Rekindles hope, banishes despair.  

Though darkness calls, and tempts astray,  
A flicker lingers, guiding the way,  
Life's melody, in ceaseless flow,  
Rekindles flames, makes spirits glow.  

In every breath, a chance reborn,  
To mend the wounds that hearts have worn,  
The yearning soul, though weighed by strife,  
Finds solace in the dance of life.  

So let the rhythmic verse resound,  
With longing depths and hope profound,  
Embracing life's enigmatic dance,  
Where death's desire finds second chance.  

For in this longing, hope transcends,  
The yearning heart, it mends and mends,  
And through the darkness, glimpses rise,  
Of life's worth seen through hopeful eyes.
